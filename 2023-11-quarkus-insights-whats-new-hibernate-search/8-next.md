## What's next?

* Vector search!
  * Non-text content/queries: audio, picture, video
  * Semantic search
  * Requires an AI model (sold separately!)
* Longer term, Debezium integration

@Notes:

* Vector search
  * Obviously, requires integration with AI (sold separately!)
  * Fingerprinting: "what's this song"
  * Semantic search: "find pictures of dogs", "find text about car repairs"
  * Generative AI... ?
* Debezium
  * Lower pressure on DB (no more polling)
  * But more importantly: detecting changes happening outside of Hibernate ORM (native SQL, ...)
